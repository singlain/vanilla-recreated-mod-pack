Vanilla ReCreated overhauls vanilla gameplay, primarily focusing on Create, Farmer's Delight, combat overhaul, sound overhaul, horses overhaul, balance changes, world generation overhaul and QoL.

Vanilla ReCreated tries to keep a balance between being heavily and lightly modded, as well as not leaving the roots of vanilla, rather overhauling old mechanics instead of adding new ones. As stated previous, modpack features only a few mods changing the gameplay, that being;
- [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric "Create") 
- [Farmers Delight](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight-refabricated "Farmers Delight")
- [Better Combat](https://modrinth.com/mod/better-combat "Better Combat")
- [End Remastered](https://modrinth.com/mod/endrem "End Remastered")

One of the main focuses of this modpack was balance, mainly player progression. Let me quickly go through the main changes;
- [Dungeon Difficulty](https://modrinth.com/mod/dungeon-difficulty "Dungeon Difficulty")
- [Villagers can change professions only a limited amount of times](https://modrinth.com/mod/villagertradefix "Villagers can change professions only a limited amount of times")
- [Villagers no longer trade Mending enchantment](https://modrinth.com/datapack/librarians-balance "Villagers no longer trade Mending enchantment")
- [Minecarts on powered rails now move at the double speed (16m/s)](https://modrinth.com/mod/fast-minecart "Minecarts on powered rails now move at the double speed (16m/s)")
- [Boats on ice no longer move **THAT** fast](https://modrinth.com/mod/ice-boat-nerf/versions "Boats on ice no longer move **THAT** fast")
- [Horses got hugely buffed (2 people on the same horse, faster moving speed, an ability to swim, horses will stay in place all the time)](https://modrinth.com/mod/horsebuff "Horses got hugely buffed (2 people on the same horse, faster moving speed, an ability to swim, horses will stay in place all the time)")

This modpack also heavily influences the way the game feels. [clouds](https://modrinth.com/mod/better-clouds "clouds") got prettier, [biome blend](https://modrinth.com/mod/bbrb "biome blend") got better, the [night sky ](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-stars "night sky ")is now filled with beautiful stars, you'll get [concussed](https://modrinth.com/mod/enhancedvisuals "concussed") after explosion, your heart will race when low on health, [rain](https://modrinth.com/mod/letitrain "rain") will keep going after sleep, [player animations](https://modrinth.com/mod/not-enough-animations/versions "player animations") are now more detailed and smooth, [snow](https://modrinth.com/mod/snow-real-magic "snow") will now spawn under trees, and of course - [leaves](https://modrinth.com/mod/fallingleaves/versions "leaves") fill now fall under the trees.

My initial goal for this modpack was sound, but it evolved into what it is. Either way, sounds are now put together really well. Sound physics, ambient sounds, a lot of new and emmersive footstep sounds, and all the magic Sounds mod does, combined with the mods before will really make the game feel much better.
